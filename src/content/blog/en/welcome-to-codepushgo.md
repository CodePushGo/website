We’re excited to announce the launch of **CodePushGo** – a fresh, open-source fork of Capgo.app, designed to make over-the-air (OTA) updates for React Native apps faster, safer, and more developer-friendly.

## Why CodePushGo?

Capgo.app has been a trusted solution for live updates in React Native apps. But as the ecosystem and developer needs evolved, we saw the opportunity to build something even better: a platform that’s open, transparent, and focused on security, compliance, and speed.

**CodePushGo** is our answer. It’s a fork, but it’s also a new beginning – with a renewed commitment to open source, developer experience, and the latest best practices.

## What’s New?

- **Open Source First**: CodePushGo is fully open source. We believe in transparency and community-driven development.
- **Modern Security**: End-to-end encryption, strong access controls, and real-time monitoring out of the box.
- **Compliance Built-In**: Designed to meet Apple and Google Play guidelines, so you can ship updates with confidence.
- **Performance**: Global CDN, fast rollouts, and robust analytics for tracking every update.
- **Community Focus**: We’re here to listen, improve, and build together.

## Our Mission

We want to empower developers to deliver updates instantly, without fear of breaking rules or compromising security. CodePushGo is built for teams who care about quality, compliance, and user experience.

## What’s Next?

- **Migration Guides**: Coming soon for Capgo.app users.
- **New Features**: Expect rapid improvements, more integrations, and better tooling.
- **Community**: Join us on GitHub, share feedback, and help shape the future of OTA updates.
