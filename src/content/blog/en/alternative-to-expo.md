Expo Live Update is a feature of the Expo platform that allows developers to deploy updates to their app in real-time, without requiring users to download a new version of the app. This is similar to the live update feature of CodePushGo, which allows developers to quickly and easily update their app's content and functionality without forcing users to go through the process of downloading and installing an update.

Both Expo Live Update and CodePushGo's live update feature are designed to make it easy for developers to provide their users with the latest app features and improvements as soon as they are available.
