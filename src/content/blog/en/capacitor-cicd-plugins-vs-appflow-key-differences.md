### Appflow Platform Features

Appflow focuses on providing a unified platform, but it sacrifices some flexibility in the process. Developers have expressed frustration with its implementation, as one shared:

> "Cancelled my @Appflow subscription after 4 years. Code-Push never seemed to work well, hopefully @CapGO has it figured out" - LeVar Berry [\[1\]](https://codepushgo.com/)

Appflow does offer tools for managing builds, deployments, and teams in one place. However, its limitations have pushed many organizations to explore other options. With over 750 apps already running on plugin-based solutions like CodePushGo [\[1\]](https://codepushgo.com/), the trend shows a growing shift toward more customizable, developer-friendly alternatives. This shift reflects a preference for solutions that prioritize flexibility and control.

## Cost Comparison

When evaluating these solutions, cost plays a key role alongside features and deployment efficiency.

### CI/CD Plugin Pricing

React Native CI/CD plugins come with a straightforward pricing model. For example, CodePushGo charges a **one-time setup fee of $2,600** and about **$300 per month** for CI/CD operations. Additionally, they offer tiered plans to accommodate different team sizes and needs.

| Plan Component | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Initial Setup | $2,600 (one-time) |
| Monthly CI/CD Operations | ~$300 |
| Tiered Plans | $12 - $249/month |

This structure is particularly appealing for long-term projects, offering budget-friendly scaling options. On the other hand, Appflow takes a different approach.

### Appflow Pricing Structure

Appflow uses an annual billing system, with costs reaching **$6,000 per year** [\[1\]](https://codepushgo.com/). This pricing has led many organizations to consider alternative solutions.

> "We are currently giving a try to @CodePushGo since Appcenter stopped live updates support on hybrid apps and @AppFlow is way too expensive." [\[1\]](https://codepushgo.com/)

Over a five-year period, plugin-based solutions like CodePushGo could save organizations approximately **$26,100** compared to Appflow [\[1\]](https://codepushgo.com/). This substantial difference, combined with Appflow's lack of flexibility and uncertain future, has made alternatives more appealing.

> "Jumped over to @CodePushGo after @AppFlow hit us with a $5000 bill for the year to continue. Loving CapoGo so far. Thanks for @CodePushGo, it's a great product." [\[1\]](https://codepushgo.com/)

As development teams aim to optimize their budgets without compromising on deployment quality, these cost differences have become increasingly significant.

## Setup and Usage

Getting your setup right is crucial for smooth development. Here's a breakdown of how these two options compare when it comes to implementation and everyday use.

This approach also allows for tailored deployments and tighter security measures.

The benefits of open-source are clear in practical use. For example, NASA's [OSIRIS-REx](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/osiris-rex/) team shared their experience:

> "@CodePushGo is a smart way to make hot code pushes (and not for all the money in the world like with @AppFlow) :-)" [\[1\]](https://codepushgo.com/)

Here's a quick comparison:

| Aspect | Open Source (CodePushGo) | Closed Source (Appflow) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code Access | Full source code visibility | Proprietary, limited access |
| Hosting Options | Self-hosted or cloud | Cloud-only |
| Customization | Unlimited modifications | Restricted by platform |
| Security Control | Full oversight | Dependent on provider |

This level of control and transparency makes open-source platforms a solid choice for long-term projects.
