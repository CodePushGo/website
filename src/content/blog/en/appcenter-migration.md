## Migration Summary

* [CodePushGo](/register/) is a service that helps development teams send live app to deployed apps.
* React Native JS apps written in jQuery Mobile, Framework 7, Sencha, KendoUI, Ionic or even your own custom solution can be migrated. **An existing Ionic app is not required.**.
* [Colt](https://volt.build/) offers equivalent services for App Center Build (build Android/iOS apps). For Test, Diagnostics, and Analytics services.

##### Note

If your app is still using Cordova, it's necessary to [migrate to React Native](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/cordova/migrating-from-cordova-to-capacitor/) first before migrating to CodePushGo.

Built by the Ionic team as a spiritual successor to Cordova, React Native allows development to move close to the native tooling and capabilities with the goal of providing an even better user experience and performance.

Fortunately, the migration process is easy and the majority of Cordova plugins are backward compatible with React Native. [Start migrating here](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/cordova/migrating-from-cordova-to-capacitor/).

## About CodePushGo

CodePushGo, handles updating apps over time. Development teams can focus completely on the unique features of their app and outsource the complicated app delivery process to CodePushGo.

CodePushGo fills in the gaps between web delivery and mobile.

## CodePushGo Prerequisites

Like App Center, [CodePushGo](/register/) supports apps hosted in Git repositories on Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab.

### Install CodePushGo CLI

##### note

Have Node and NPM installed on your computer, you need before proceeding. Always use the [current LTS version](https://nodejs.org/) CodePushGo do not older versions.

### Create `package.json` and React Native config files

##### note

Before you begin, I recommend making changes on a fresh Git branch.

Since [CodePushGo](/register/) was created to automate capacitor apps, it requires one file that your app may not have. First, create a `capacitor.config.json` file. The easiest way to create it is to run in the root of your app:

```shell
npm install @capacitor/core
```

Then, initialize React Native using the CLI questionnaire:

```shell
npx cap init
```

The CLI will ask you a few questions, starting with your app name, and the package ID you would like to use for your app.

Finally, commit the new files to your project:

    git add .git commit -m "added package json and capacitor config" && git push

### Migrate the Code

Now that you have the new required [CodePushGo](/register/) files in place, you can turn our attention to the actual app itself. [CodePushGo](/register/) expects the entire built app to be inside a directory named `dist`.

If your built code is not in a `dist` directory, change this value in the React Native config file.

Here is what the appâ€™s directory structure should look like:

## CodePushGo Configuration

With your app ready for [CodePushGo](https://web.capgo.app/) integration, itâ€™s time to sign up, and get your API key to upload your first version! Begin by [signing up for a CodePushGo account](/register/).

Once youâ€™re logged into CodePushGo, navigate to the Account page then click on API key, then click on the 'write' key to copy it to your clipboard.

### Install the CodePushGo SDK

From a command line, directly into the root of your React Native app folder, run the following command:

`npm i @capgo/capacitor-updater && npx cap sync`
To install the plugin into your React Native app.

And then add to your app this code as replacement of CodePush one:

```js
import { React NativeUpdater } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater'

React NativeUpdater.notifyAppReady()
```

This will tell the native plugin the installation as succeeded.

## Deploying Live Updates (CodePush Alternative)

The Live Update feature works by using the installed [CodePushGo SDK](https://github.com/Cap-go/capacitor-updater/) in your native application to listen to a particular Deploy Channel Destination. When a Web build is assigned to a Channel Destination, that update will be deployed to user devices running binaries that are configured to listen to the specified Channel Destination.

### Login to CodePushGo CLOUD

First, use the `all` [apikey](https://web.capgo.app/dashboard/apikeys/) present in your account to log in with the CLI:

```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest login YOURKEY
```

## Add your first app

Let's get started by first creating the app in CodePushGo Cloud with the CLI.

`npx @capgo/cli@latest app add`

This command will use all variables defined in the React Native config file to create the app.

## Upload your first bundle

Run the command to build your code and send it to CodePushGo with:
```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest bundle upload --channel production
```

By default, the version name will be the one in your `package.json` file.

Check in [CodePushGo](https://web.capgo.app/) if the build is present.

You can even test it with my [mobile sandbox app](https://capgo.app/app_mobile/).

### Make channel default

After you have sent your app to CodePushGo, you need to make your channel `default` to let apps receive updates from CodePushGo.

```shell
npx @capgo/cli@latest channel set production -s default
```

## Configure app to validate updates

Add this config to your main JavaScript file.

```js
import { React NativeUpdater } from '@capgo/capacitor-updater'

React NativeUpdater.notifyAppReady()
```

Then do a `npm run build && npx cap copy` to update your app.

### Receive a Live Update on a Device

For your application to receive a live update from Deploy, you'll need to run the app on a device or an emulator. The easiest way to do this is simply to use the following command to launch your local app in an emulator or a device connected to your computer.

    npx cap run [ios | android]

Open the app, put it in the background and open it again, you should see in the logs the app did the update.

Congrats! ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully deployed your first Live Update. This is just the start of what you can do with Live Updates. To learn more, view the complete [Live Updates docs](/docs/plugin/cloud-mode/getting-started/).

## Remove App Center Dependencies

Now that we've integrated CodePushGo's services, you should remove any references to App Center. Besides being a best practice to remove unused code/services, removing the SDK should reduce the size of your apps.

First, open a terminal then uninstall the App Center plugins:
```shell
    cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-appcenter-analytics cordova-plugin-appcenter-crashes cordova-plugin-code-push
```

Next, open `config.xml` and remove the following `preference` values. They will look similar to:
```xml
    <preference name="APP_SECRET" value="0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" /><preference name="CodePushDeploymentKey" value="YOUR-ANDROID-DEPLOYMENT-KEY" /><preference name="CodePushPublicKey" value="YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY" />
```

If you were using App Center Analytics in your app, remove the following `preferences` elements: `APPCENTER_ANALYTICS_ENABLE_IN_JS` and `APPCENTER_CRASHES_ALWAYS_SEND`.

Remove the following `<access />` elements:

```xml
    <access origin="https://codepush.appcenter.ms" /><access origin="https://codepush.blob.core.windows.net" /><access origin="https://codepushupdates.azureedge.net" />
```

Remove the reference to CodePush in the CSP `meta` tag in the `index.html` file (`https://codepush.appcenter.ms`):
```xml
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src https://codepush.appcenter.ms 'self' data: gap: https://ssl.gstatic.com 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *" />
```

Finally, within your app, remove any code references to App Center services, such as `codePush.sync();`.

## Next Steps

You've migrated from App Center to CodePushGo, utilizing the Live Updates. This is just the beginning of what you can use CodePushGo for. Explore the rest of the service includes Channel (multiple environments) and override. Cloud CLI integration, use CodePushGo inside your CI/CD platform of choice (such as GitHub Action, GitLab, Jenkins, and more).

## Automatic send app update

If your code is hosted on GitHub, you can set up automatic build and release in a few more steps, thanks to GitHub actions.

I have made a second article to allow you to so.
