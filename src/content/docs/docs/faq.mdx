If you have questions not answered here, please ask! Both filing an issue or asking on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/VnYRvBfgA6) work.

### What is "code push"?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/#what-is-code-push "Direct link to What is \"code push\"?")

Code push, also referred to as "over the air updates" (OTA) is a cloud service enabling React Native developers to deploy updates to their apps in production. CodePushGo currently works on Android and iOS and will eventually work everywhere React Native works.

"Code Push" is a reference to the name of a deploy feature used by the React Native community from [Microsoft](https://appcenter.ms/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/), neither of which support React Native.

### What is the difference between a bundle and a release?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-is-the-difference-between-a-bundle-and-a-release "Direct link to What is the difference between a bundle and a release?")

We use the term "release" to mean preparing a binary for the app stores. In order to later generate a bundle CodePushGo needs to know the exact binary that was shipped to the app stores.

We use the term "bundle" to mean a patch that can be applied to a release to update it to new code. The `npx @codepushgo/cli app update` command is used to generate a bundle from your new local code which is then shipped to your users.

### What is the roadmap?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-is-the-roadmap "Direct link to What is the roadmap?")

Our project boards are also public an found at: [https://github.com/orgs/Cap-go/projects](https://github.com/orgs/Cap-go/projects/)

Our team also operates in the public, so you can see what we're working on at any time. We're happy to answer any questions you have about our roadmap or priorities via Github issues or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/VnYRvBfgA6).

### Can I use CodePushGo with my team?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#can-i-use-codepushgo-with-my-team "Direct link to Can I use CodePushGo with my team?")

Yes! All plans support unlimited developers. We only limit app metrics (MAU, sotrage and bandwidth) to each organization.

See [Teams](https://codepushgo.com/pricing/) for more information.

### Does CodePushGo store my source code?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#does-codepushgo-store-my-source-code "Direct link to Does CodePushGo store my source code?")

No. CodePushGo servers never see your source code. When you run `npx @codepushgo/cli app update` the `npx @codepushgo/cli` tool only uploads the same compiled code that you send to the app stores. If you desire additional security, you can use End to End encryption to encrypt your bundle before uploading it to CodePushGo servers.

### Can I use CodePushGo from my CI system?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#can-i-use-codepushgo-from-my-ci-system "Direct link to Can I use CodePushGo from my CI system?")

Yes. CodePushGo is intended to be used from CI systems. We've published a guide for [Android and Github Actions](https://codepushgo.com/blog/automatic-capacitor-android-build-github-action/) and [IOS](https://codepushgo.com/blog/automatic-capacitor-ios-build-github-action/), And for [Gitlab](https://codepushgo.com/blog/setup-ci-and-cd-gitlab/) other CI systems should be similar.

Please don't hesitate to reach out over GitHub issues or Discord if you encounter any issues.

### How does this relate to Firebase Remote Config or Launch Darkly?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-does-this-relate-to-firebase-remote-config-or-launch-darkly "Direct link to How does this relate to Firebase Remote Config or Launch Darkly?")

Code push allows adding new code / replacing code on the device. Firebase Remote Config and Launch Darkly are both configuration systems. They allow you to change the configuration of your app without having to ship a new version. They are not intended to replace code.

### How big of a dependency footprint does this add?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-big-of-a-dependency-footprint-does-this-add "Direct link to How big of a dependency footprint does this add?")

I haven't measured recently, but I expect the code push library to add less than one megabyte to React Native apps. We know of ways we can make this smaller when that becomes a priority. If size is a blocker for you, please let us know!

### Does code push work with large applications?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#does-code-push-work-with-large-applications "Direct link to Does code push work with large applications?")

Yes. There is no limit on the size of the application that can be updated with code push. As noted [below](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-types-of-changes-does-codepushgo-code-push-support), CodePushGo can change any JS code in your application no matter of size.

To note: A bigger size make it harder for users to download updates. We recommend keeping your app as small as possible.

### What can I use CodePushGo code push for?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-can-i-use-codepushgo-code-push-for "Direct link to What can I use CodePushGo code push for?")

We've seen a variety of uses, including:

-   Emergency fixes to production apps.
-   Shipping bug fixes to users on older versions of your app.
-   Shipping constantly (e.g. every hour).

Note that most app stores prohibit shipping code that changes the behavior of the app in a significant way. Please see [below](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-does-this-relate-to-the-appplay-store-review-process-or-policies) for more information.

### What counts as a "MAU" for CodePushGo?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-counts-as-a-mau-for-codepushgo "Direct link to What counts as a \"MAU\" for CodePushGo?")

A MAU is a "Monthly Active User". We count a MAU as any device that has contacted our servers in the last 30 days. We do not count devices that have not contacted our servers in the last 30 days.

Each time a device install your app again, a new MAU is counted, this happen because Apple store limitation about privacy. We cannot track the same device if the user reinstall the app.

During development, each time you reinstall the app, a new MAU is counted.

Same for testflight download or switch channel in Android. Updating the app do not create a new Device ID.

> We recommend after first setup, to disabled dev devices and emulator to reduce the ammount of duplicated devices.

### What can't we use CodePushGo code push for?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-cant-we-use-codepushgo-code-push-for "Direct link to What can't we use CodePushGo code push for?")

As above, CodePushGo should not be used to violate app store polices. Please see [below](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#does-codepushgo-comply-with-play-store-guidelines) for more information.

Also CodePushGo does not support changing native code (e.g. Java/Kotlin on Android or Objective-C/Swift on iOS). The tool will warn you during an attempted update if you have changed native code.

### Does CodePushGo submit to the stores for me?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#does-codepushgo-submit-to-the-stores-for-me "Direct link to Does CodePushGo submit to the stores for me?")

CodePushGo does not currently support submitting to the app stores on your behalf. We have plans to add this in the future, but for now you will need to continue to use your existing processes to submit to the app stores. 

You can use our [CI guide Android](https://codepushgo.com/blog/automatic-capacitor-android-build-github-action/) to automate this process and [CI guide iOS](https://codepushgo.com/blog/automatic-capacitor-ios-build-github-action/).

### What does CodePushGo store on disk and where?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-does-codepushgo-store-on-disk-and-where "Direct link to What does CodePushGo store on disk and where?")

The CodePushGo updater (included in your application when you build your app) caches the latest downloaded bundle in the only directory that React Native allow to load code. On Android, this is located in `/data/user/0/com.example.app/code_cache/codepushgo_updater` although the base of that path is provided by the Android system and can change dynamically at runtime. On iOS devices, data is stored under `Library/Application Support/codepushgo`.

The CodePushGo command line tools (e.g. `npx @codepushgo/cli app update`) are installed on disk in npm caches, your logins are stored in your home directory in `~/.codepushgo`.

### How does this relate to React Native Hot Reload?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-does-this-relate-to-capacitor-hot-reload "Direct link to How does this relate to React Native Hot Reload?")

React Native's Hot reload is a development-time-only feature. Code push is for production.

Hot reload is a feature of React Native that allows you to change code on the device during development. It requires building the React Native app with a proxy to connect to your local machine.

Code push is a feature that allows you to change code on the device in production. We will use a variety of different techniques to make this possible depending on the platform.

### What types of changes does CodePushGo code push support?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-types-of-changes-does-codepushgo-code-push-support "Direct link to What types of changes does CodePushGo code push support?")

CodePushGo can change any JS code in your application. This includes app code and generated code. You can also update dependencies in `packages.json` as long as they don't require native code changes.

We do not have plans to support changing native code (e.g. Java/Kotlin on Android or Objective-C/Swift on iOS), and the tool will warn you if it detects that you have changed native code as it will not be included in the bundle.

### Does this support Web?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#does-this-support-web "Direct link to Does this support Flutter Web?")

Code push isn't needed for web as the web already works this way. When a user opens a web app it downloads the latest version from the server if needed.

If you have a use case for code push with web, we'd love to know !

### Will this work on iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, etc?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#will-this-work-on-ios-android-mac-windows-linux-etc "Direct link to Will this work on iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, etc?")

Yes.

So far we've focused on Android and iOS support, but code push will eventually work everywhere React Native works. We're ensuring we've built all the infrastructure needed to provide code push reliably, safely first before expanding to more platforms.

### What OS versions does CodePushGo support?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-os-versions-does-codepushgo-support "Direct link to What OS versions does CodePushGo support?")

CodePushGo supports the same versions of Android that React Native supports.

React Native currently supports Android API level 22+ and iOS 13.0+: [https://capacitorjs.com/docs/main/reference/support-policy](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/main/reference/support-policy/)

### What versions of React Native does CodePushGo support?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-versions-of-flutter-does-codepushgo-support "Direct link to What versions of Flutter does CodePushGo support?")

CodePushGo currently supports only recent stable releases of React Native. We could support older versions of React Native as well, we just haven't built out the infrastructure necessary to maintain such over time. We intend to support more versions of React Native in the future, including any version for our enterprise customers. [https://github.com/Cap-go/codepushgo/issues/1100](https://github.com/Cap-go/codepushgo/issues/1100/)

CodePushGo tracks Flutter stable and generally updates within a few hours of any stable release. Our system for doing these updates is automated takes a few minutes to run. We then do an extra manual verification step before publishing to our servers.

### How does this relate to the App/Play Store review process or policies?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-does-this-relate-to-the-appplay-store-review-process-or-policies "Direct link to How does this relate to the App/Play Store review process or policies?")

Developers are bound by their agreements with store providers when they choose to use those stores. Code push is designed to allow developers to update their apps and still comply with store policies on iOS and Android. Similar to the variety of commercial products available to do so with React Native (e.g. [Microsoft](https://appcenter.ms/), [Expo](https://expo.dev/)).

Microsoft also publishes a guide on how their solution complies with the app stores: [https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push#store-guideline-compliance](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/#store-guideline-compliance)

Code push is a widely used technique throughout the app stores. All of the large apps I'm aware of use code push. The major policy to be aware of is not to change the behavior of the app in a significant way. Please see [below](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#does-codepushgo-comply-with-play-store-guidelines) for more information.

### Does CodePushGo comply with Play Store guidelines?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#does-codepushgo-comply-with-play-store-guidelines "Direct link to Does CodePushGo comply with Play Store guidelines?")

Yes.

The Play Store offers two restrictions relating to update tools.

1.  Updates must use an interpreter or virtual machine (CodePushGo uses the Dart Virtual Machine). [https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888379?hl=en](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888379/?hl=en)

```
<span><span>    An app distributed via Google Play may not modify, replace, or update itself</span><br></span><span><span>    using any method other than Google Play's update mechanism. Likewise, an app</span><br></span><span><span>    may not download executable code (such as dex, JAR, .so files) from a</span><br></span><span><span>    source other than Google Play. *This restriction does not apply to code</span><br></span><span><span>    that runs in a virtual machine or an interpreter* where either provides</span><br></span><span><span>    indirect access to Android APIs (such as JavaScript in a webview or</span><br></span><span><span>    browser).</span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    Apps or third-party code, like SDKs, with interpreted languages (JavaScript,</span><br></span><span><span>    Python, Lua, etc.) loaded at run time (for example, not packaged with the</span><br></span><span><span>    app) must not allow potential violations of Google Play policies.</span><br></span>
```

2.  Changes to the app must not be deceptive (e.g. changing the purpose of the app via update). [https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888077](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888077/) Please be clear with your users about what you are providing with your application and do not violate their expectations with significant behavioral changes through the use of CodePushGo.

CodePushGo is designed to be compatible with the Play Store guidelines. However CodePushGo is a tool, and as with any tool, can be abused. Deliberately abusing CodePushGo to violate Play Store guidelines is in violation of the CodePushGo [Terms of Service](https://codepushgo.com/tos/) and can result in termination of your account.

Finally, code push services are widely used in the industry (all of the large apps I'm aware of use them) and there are multiple other code push services publicly available (e.g. expo.dev & appcenter.ms). This is a well trodden path.

Microsoft also publishes a guide on how their react native "codepush" library complies with the app stores: [https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push#store-guideline-compliance](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/#store-guideline-compliance)

### Does CodePushGo comply with App Store guidelines?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#does-codepushgo-comply-with-app-store-guidelines "Direct link to Does CodePushGo comply with App Store guidelines?")

Yes.

Similar to the Play Store, the App Store offers both technical and policy restrictions.

```
<span><span>3.2.2</span><br></span><span><span>... interpreted code may be downloaded to an Application but only so long as</span><br></span><span><span>such code:</span><br></span><span><span>(a) does not change the primary purpose of the Application by providing</span><br></span><span><span>features or functionality that are inconsistent with the intended and</span><br></span><span><span>advertised purpose of the Application as submitted to the App Store,</span><br></span><span><span>(b) does not create a store or storefront for other code or applications, and</span><br></span><span><span>(c) does not bypass signing, sandbox, or other security features of the OS.</span><br></span>
```

CodePushGo uses a custom Dart interpreter to comply with the interpreter-only restriction for updates on iOS. So long as your application is not engaging in deceptive behavior via updates (e.g. changing the purpose of the app via update), updating via CodePushGo (or any other code push solution) is standard industry practice and compliant with App Store guidelines.

Deliberately abusing CodePushGo to violate App Store guidelines is in violation of the CodePushGo [Terms of Service](https://codepushgo.com/tos/) and can result in termination of your account.

Microsoft also publishes a guide on how their react native "codepush" library complies with the app stores: [https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push#store-guideline-compliance](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/#store-guideline-compliance)

### Can I use CodePushGo in my country?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#can-i-use-codepushgo-in-my-country "Direct link to Can I use CodePushGo in my country?")

We have not attempted to restrict access to CodePushGo from any country.

We recognize that some countries have restrictions on what urls can be accessed from within the country. CodePushGo currently uses Cloudflare Cloud for hosting, including R2 Storage and Cloudflare workers.

The following URLs are used by CodePushGo:

-   [https://api.codepushgo.com](https://api.codepushgo.com/) -- used by the `npx @codepushgo/cli` command line tools to interact with the CodePushGo servers as well as the CodePushGo updater on users' devices to check for updates.
-   [https://*.r2.cloudflarestorage.com](https://*.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/) -- used by the `npx @codepushgo/cli` command line tool to upload and download bundle

If all of those URLs are accessible from your country, then CodePushGo should work.

If your region requires blocking access to any of those URLs, please let us know and we can work with you to find a solution. Proxy servers are one option.

### Can I self-host CodePushGo?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#can-i-self-host-codepushgo "Direct link to Can I self-host CodePushGo?")

Yes, you can self-host CodePushGo. The guide is not yet written, but the code is open source and available at [https://github.com/cap-go/codepushgo](https://github.com/cap-go/codepushgo/)

### Does code push require the internet to work?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#does-code-push-require-the-internet-to-work "Direct link to Does code push require the internet to work?")

Yes. One could imagine running a server to distribute the updates separately from the general internet, but some form of network connectivity is required to transport updates to the devices.

### How is CodePushGo affected by lack of network connectivity?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-is-codepushgo-affected-by-lack-of-network-connectivity "Direct link to How is CodePushGo affected by lack of network connectivity?")

CodePushGo updater (included in your application when you build your app with CodePushGo) is designed to be resilient to network connectivity issues.

In the default update behavior, when the application launches it alerts the CodePushGo updater, which spawns a separate thread to make a network request to CodePushGo's servers and ask for an update. We intentionally use a separate thread to avoid affecting blocking anything else the application might be doing. If the network request fails or times out, the updater will simply try to check again next time the application launches.

CodePushGo command line tools (e.g. `npx @codepushgo/cli app update`) require network connectivity to function. If you are using CodePushGo to distribute your app, you should ensure that your CI system has network connectivity.

### What happens if a user doesn't update for a long time and misses an update?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-happens-if-a-user-doesnt-update-for-a-long-time-and-misses-an-update "Direct link to What happens if a user doesn't update for a long time and misses an update?")

Our implementation always sends an update specifically tailored for the device that is requesting it updating the requestor always to the latest version available. Thus if a user doesn't update for a while they will "miss" intermediate updates.

The update server could be changed to support responding with either the next incremental version or the latest version depending on your application's needs. Please let us know if alternative update behaviors are important to you.

### How does CodePushGo relate to React Native?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-does-codepushgo-relate-to-React Native "Direct link to How does CodePushGo relate to React Native?")

CodePushGo is a plugin for React Native that adds code push. CodePushGo is not a replacement for React Native. You can continue to use the React Native tooling you already know and love.

We track the latest stable release of React Native and update our code push plugin to work with it.

### When do updates happen?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#when-do-updates-happen "Direct link to When do updates happen?")

By default, the CodePushGo updater checks for updates on app startup. It runs on a background thread and does not block the UI thread. Any updates will be installed while the user is using the app and will be applied the next time the app is restarted.

It is also possible to run the CodePushGo updater manually using [package:codepushgo\_code\_push](https://pub.dev/packages/codepushgo_code_push/), through which it is possible to trigger updates at any time, including via a push notification.

The CodePushGo updater is designed such that when the network is not available, or the server is down or otherwise unreachable, the app will continue to run as normal. Should you ever choose to delete an update from our servers, all your clients will continue to run as normal.

We have added the ability to rollback patches. The simplest thing is to simply attach a previous bundle to your channel to undo.

### Do I need to keep my app\_id secret?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#do-i-need-to-keep-my-app_id-secret "Direct link to Do I need to keep my app_id secret?")

No. The `app_id` is included in your app and is safe to be public. You can check it into version control (even publicly) and not worry about someone else accessing it.

Someone who has your `app_id` can fetch the latest version of your app from CodePushGo servers, but they cannot push updates to your app or access any other aspect of your CodePushGo account.

### What information is sent to CodePushGo servers?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-information-is-sent-to-codepushgo-servers "Direct link to What information is sent to CodePushGo servers?")

Although CodePushGo connects to the network, it does not send any personally identifiable information. Including CodePushGo should not affect your declarations for the Play Store or App Store.

Requests sent from the app to CodePushGo servers include:

-   app\_id (specified `capacitor.config.json`)
-   channel (optional in `capacitor.config.json`)
-   release\_version (versionName from AndroidManifest.xml or CFBundleShortVersionString from Info.plist or `capacitor.config.json` if set in [`React NativeUpdater.version`](/docs/plugin/settings/#version) )
-   version\_number (generated as part of `npx @codepushgo/cli app update`)
-   os_version (e.g. '11.2.1')
-   platform (e.g. 'android', needed to send down the right patch) That's it. The code for this is in `updater/library/src/network.rs`
-   device\_id (generated on the device on first run, used to de-duplicate per-device installs and allow us to charge based on users installed to (e.g. monthly active users), rather than total patches or total patch installs)
-   custom\_id ( optional, set at runtime by the developer, used for you to link a device to a user in your system)

### What platforms does CodePushGo support?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-platforms-does-codepushgo-support "Direct link to What platforms does CodePushGo support?")

Currently, CodePushGo supports iOS and Android. Both are production ready.

Use of CodePushGo for iOS or Android can be independent decisions. You can set in your channel to ship to Android and an ipa built to the App Store or vice versa.

CodePushGo can (relatively easily) be made to support desktop or embedded targets. If those are important to you, please let us know.

### How does CodePushGo interact with Play Testing Tracks or Apple TestFlight?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-does-codepushgo-interact-with-play-testing-tracks-or-apple-testflight "Direct link to How does CodePushGo interact with Play Testing Tracks or Apple TestFlight?")

Each of the app stores have separate mechanisms for distributing apps to limited groups of users (e.g. "internal testing", "closed beta", etc.). These are all mechanisms for segmenting your users into groups and distributing specific versions of your apps to each.

Unfortunately, these not all of these mechanisms allow 3rd parties to detect when apps are installed in any specific Test Track or via TestFlight. Thus, we do not have reliable visibility into composition of these groups, and cannot reliably gate access to CodePushGo patches based on these groups. [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53291007/can-an-android-application-identify-the-test-track-within-google-play](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53291007/can-an-android-application-identify-the-test-track-within-google-play/) [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26081543/how-to-tell-at-runtime-whether-an-ios-app-is-running-through-a-testflight-beta-i](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26081543/how-to-tell-at-runtime-whether-an-ios-app-is-running-through-a-testflight-beta-i/)

If you'd like to segment availability of CodePushGo bundle, there are 4 potential options:

1.  Use separate channel for each group. This is the most straightforward approach, but requires you to manage multiple channels. You may already have a dev channels and prod channels with different availability. You can thus update your dev channels, verify it and then separately update your prod channels. We recommend using branches / tags in your version control to help keep track of the sources associated with each release.
2.  Track your own set of opt-in users, disable automatic updates, and trigger updates only for certain users via package:codepushgo\_code\_push. This works today, but requires you to manage your own opt-in list.
3.  CodePushGo allow creare its own opt-in mechanism on a per-device basis (similar to Test Tracks or TestFlight, just platform agnostic). This allow your QA team to opt-in to bundle before they're promoted to the general public.
4.  CodePushGo have percentage based rollouts. This does not let you choose which devices to send to, but can help you roll out incrementally and roll-back on sight of any problems.

## Billing[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#billing "Direct link to Billing")

### How do I upgrade or downgrade my plan?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-do-i-upgrade-or-downgrade-my-plan "Direct link to How do I upgrade or downgrade my plan?")

You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time in your dashboard: [https://web.codepushgo.com/dashboard/settings/plans](https://web.codepushgo.com/dashboard/settings/plans/)

### When does my billing period reset?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#when-does-my-billing-period-reset "Direct link to When does my billing period reset?")

Billing periods are reset automatically every month on the month you first subscribed to CodePushGo. For example, if you subscribed on the 15th of the month, your billing period will reset on the 15th of every month.

### How do I cancel my subscription?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-do-i-cancel-my-subscription "Direct link to How do I cancel my subscription?")

You can cancel your subscription at any time in your dashboard: [https://web.codepushgo.com/dashboard/settings/plans](https://web.codepushgo.com/dashboard/settings/plans/)

### Can I pay for a year in advance?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#can-i-pay-for-a-year-in-advance "Direct link to Can I pay for a year in advance?")

Yes you can can at any time in your dashboard: [https://web.codepushgo.com/dashboard/settings/plans](https://web.codepushgo.com/dashboard/settings/plans/)

### Stats and analytics[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#stats-and-analytics "Direct link to Stats and analytics")

The stats in your dashboard are updated every midnight UTC.
The stats are calculated based on the number of [MAU](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#what-is-the-difference-between-a-bundle-and-a-release "Direct link to What is the difference between a bundle and a release?") that have been installed on your devices.

# How device ID is generated[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-device-id-is-generated "Direct link to How device ID is generated")

The device ID is generated on the device on first run, and is used to de-duplicate per-device installs and allow us to charge based on users installed to (e.g. monthly active users), rather than total patches or total patch installs.

MAU is a better solution than number of installs to price CodePushGo, as it is more accurate and reflects the actual cost of CodePushGo per device.

For privacy reasons, we cannot track the same device if the user reinstall the app.

The privacy rules are enforced by Apple and Google, and are not enforced by CodePushGo.

Device ID will not be listed in your device list until they get they first patch installed.

# Why my device number is different than my MAU?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#why-my-device-number-is-different-than-my-mau "Direct link to Why my device number is different than my MAU?")

Currently, the device list is not updated as often as the MAU.

The device list is updated only when a device installs an update.

While the MAU is updated at every app launch. This is a current limitation of the platform. Our Analytics platform do not support raw updates so we use conventional database for Devices list.

To limit the number of database queries, we do update row only on app update.

This limitation will be removed in the future.

# How to have different update by platform?[](https://codepushgo.com/docs/faq/#how-to-have-different-update-by-platform "Direct link to How to have different update by platform?")

You can create a channel for each platform. and disable platform specific updates in each channel. 

On ios channel disable android updates and on android channel disable ios updates.

Then upload a bundle to each channel to have different update for each platform.

If you need to have the same update for both platform, you can link one bundle to multiple channels. No need to duplicate the bundle.
